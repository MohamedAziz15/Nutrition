# Nutrition
We build a fitness system that can help a coach to calculate nutrition facts (such as. Fats, protein, Carb, NA, K, etc) and then save this customized nutrition plan as a pdf file to send to clients.
We use an SQL server For the database, C# for building a Windows form, and using MetroModernUI for UI elements like a button and labels......etc.
